# Turkce-Python it was always my dream to program in türkish language. Very difficult and time consuming to create a new language.
# Instead of new language i am trying to convert python to the grammer of turkish language .
# For example :
              instead of   for a in range(4,9):    ...    a 4 den 9 a : 
              instead of   for itm in list:       ...    list deki itm için : 
              instead of    print   ........  .......    yaz
              instead of    def fxn(a,b):   .......    fonks fxn(a,b):
              instead of    return     .........    döndür veya dönder
                            a=[]   ......  ........  a bir liste
                            a.append("hhh") ........ a ekle "hhh"
                            a.extend(1,2,3,4,5) .....a uzat 1,2,3,4,5
                            
              Turkish sentences  changes into corresponding python sentences then executed..
              
              .....  so on...   try and see
              
              we have a nice tkinter gui also
              
              
              REQUİREMENT:
                  . .  Python2.7 is required to run these program.
